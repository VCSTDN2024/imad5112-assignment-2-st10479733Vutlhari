#MemoryLane
MemoryLane is a quiz app created to test the users knowledge of history and theories. This quiz app was built using Kotlin and Andriod Studio.
The app is simple, clean, and a fun way to keep your mind active. The reason i created MemoryLane is to learn how to handle user input, navigation between 
screens and basic logic in mobile apps. I didn't want just another templete-based quiz-this app reflects how i learn and think.
